        <h1>Welcome to Brett's application to BentoBox.</h1>

        <p>In my cover letter I explained that I started The Odin Project
        a few weeks ago. This is the first website I have built from scratch.
        It took me a couple of hours, but I thought it would be a fun way
        for me to interview you.</p>

        <p>So I'm going to ask you some super fair questions:</p>

            <form action="/action_page.php">
            <p>Would you like your new hire to have a sense of humor?</p>
                <label for="humor"></label>
                <select id="humor" name="humor">
                    <option>Yes</option>
                    <option>Yes</option>
                </select>
            <p>Would you like your new hire to be drama free?</p>
                <label for="drama"></label>
                <select id="drama" name="drama">
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                </select> 
            <p>Would you like your new hire to enjoy learning new skills?</p>
                <label for="skills"></label>
                <select id="skills" name="skills">
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                </select>  
            <p>Would you like your new hire to have optimism?</p>
                <label for="optimist"></label>
                <select id="optimist" name="optimist">
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                    <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
                </select> 
            </form>

        <div class="submit">
            <button onclick="submitFunction()">Submit</button>  
            <script src="script/script.js"></script>
        </div>

        <p>* This site would have more bells and whistles but I wanted
        to make sure my application was submitted before the position was filled.
        And let's be honest, I would have to learn some bells and whistles 
        before I could jazz it up anyway. </p>
